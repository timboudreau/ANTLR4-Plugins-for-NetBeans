/**
 * Main entry point to live running of generated Antlr grammars. This class does
 * a LOT:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is passed a "runner" - really a holder for the JFSClassLoader which
 * can set it and invoke ParserExtractor that was generated and compiled with
 * the grammar in the classloader, returning a ParseTreeProxy which does not
 * leak instances from the classloader (everything is wrappered as proxy objects
 * and java primitives)</li>
 * <li>It keeps track of the last modified state of the grammar files, and if
 * out of date, the next call to parse() will first force ParserManager to
 * reparse the grammar file (which will indirectly trigger a reentrant call to
 * accept, setting a new environment).</li>
 * <li>It keeps the last parse result and text, and if they are the same and the
 * environment is not stale, will reuse them</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Instanes should be manually disposed when no longer needed, so the
 * JFSClassloader and potentially the JFS it belongs to can also be closed
 * (right now this only happens if the owning Project is garbage collected, but
 * eventually it should be discarded after sufficient lack of use).
